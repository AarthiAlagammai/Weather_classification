# Weather_classification
Weather classification Project using Convolutional Neural Network
This project is developed as part for Intel Edge AI Scholarhip Challenge 2020 
# Goal
Develop a weather classification application to be deployable at the edge using Intel's OpenVINO Toolkit.
# Motivation
There is a huge development and scope for ADAS system in the current era.The weather classification has a huge impact on our daily lives as wells affects vechile assistant systems, outdoor video surveillance systems.So we designed a system using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify weather into 6 different categories like Rain, Cloudy ,Haze ,Thunder ,Snow ,Sunny.The main aim of this project is to support weather classification as a new feature to the ADAS system the team was developing and deploy it as edge application.
